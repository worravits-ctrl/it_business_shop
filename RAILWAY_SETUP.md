# Railway Deployment Configuration Guide

## Environment Variables Setup

### Required Variables (ตั้งใน Railway Dashboard)
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=it-business-shop-secret-key-2025-super-secure  
PORT=8000
```

### Database Connection (Auto-generated by Railway)
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

## Services Required

### 1. Web Service (Python App)
- Source: GitHub repository
- Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start Command: `python app_main.py`

### 2. PostgreSQL Database
- Add via Railway dashboard
- DATABASE_URL will be auto-generated and injected

## Deployment Process

1. Railway detects Python app from repository
2. Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Runs app_main.py which:
   - Creates database tables automatically
   - Creates admin user if not exists
   - Starts Flask server on port from environment

## Post-Deployment

### Admin Access
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

### Application URL
- Railway provides: https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
- Custom domain can be configured in Railway dashboard

## Monitoring

### Logs
- Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
- Monitor application performance
- View database metrics

### Scaling
- Railway auto-scales based on traffic
- Can configure resource limits in dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failure**: Check requirements.txt
2. **Database Connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL is set
3. **Port Issues**: Ensure PORT environment variable is set
4. **Static Files**: Files served directly by Flask (no CDN needed)

### Health Check
Access `/test` endpoint to verify:
- Application status
- Database connection
- User count and details
